# github actions quickstart

this repo is part 1 of HW02 for CS3500 Software Engineering.

It demonstrates some practice with how to use GitHub actions as well as how to read and give feedback on documentation. 

Here is the text feedback that I gave for the GitHub Actions documentation:

it's not clear whether you want users to make the .github/workflows directory and github-actions-demo.yml file in their terminal and then push it, or on the github website! it would be helpful to clarify this, or link to documentation on how to create just a directory within a github repo (i could not figure out how to do this)
